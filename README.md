## General Description
Please add a general description, what is this code, what does it do?

Example data can be found here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NQ7_B-Anl9fuflKSxTIWzyC-fXOVihZb?usp=sharing

## Procedure

Please organize the data as in the format provided. -- give more detail! How is that?
Put the Data folder inside the Clustering main folder. -- what does this mean?

Run clustering_main.m

The code might need to work for a long time, even 24h. 

It is suggested to run the code in sections one by one, saving the workspace after the Check Parameters Relevancy section, and after the Clustering section (the slowest), to minimize the risk of time lost.
